# Chapter X: [Title of the Chapter]
**Date:** 202X-XX-XX
**Focus:** Key concepts relevant to Signal Processing

## 💡 Key Concepts (Summary)
- **Concept A:** Explanation...
- **Concept B:** Explanation...

## 🧮 Mathematical Insight
- Why is this important?
    - e.g., The Nullspace tells us about the "lost" information in the transformation...
- Formula:
    $$Ax = b$$

## 💻 Python Implementation (Experiments)
> See `notebooks/chapter_X.ipynb` for full code.

**Experiment:** [e.g., Visualize column space]
- **Result:** The vector $b$ was not in the column space of $A$, so the equation had no solution.
- **Interpretation:** This corresponds to "noise" in signal processing.
