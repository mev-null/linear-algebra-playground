# Linear Algebra for Signal Processing & Neuroscience

This repository documents my learning journey of linear algebra, focusing on applications in signal processing and machine learning for brain science. 

The implementations and notes are based on Gilbert Strang's **"Linear Algebra for Everyone"**.

## 🎯 Objective
My goal is to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and practical implementations to prepare for advanced research in:
- **Neural Signal Processing** (extracting meaning from brain signals)
- **Graph Signal Processing**
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
